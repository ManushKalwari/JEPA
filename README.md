# Self-Supervised Learning with Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA)

## Overview
This project explores the potential of the **Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA)** for learning high-level representations through **self-supervised learning (SSL)**. Inspired by human cognitive abilities to generalize through observation, JEPA learns latent representations of data.

### Key Objectives
1. Train a simplified JEPA model using **unlabeled images of dogs and cats**.
2. Test the learned representations on **images of tigers and foxes**.
3. Analyze the generalization ability through **clustering and visualization** of the learned representations.

## Features
- Preprocessing pipeline for handling and augmenting image data.
- Training and testing of a JEPA-based SSL model.
- Visualization of learned latent space representations.
- Clustering to uncover inherent patterns in representations.
